Garbage Classification

About Garbage Classification Project

The accumulation of solid waste in the urban area is becoming a great concern, and it would result in environmental pollution and may be hazardous to human health if 
it is not properly managed. It is important to have an advanced/intelligent waste management system to manage a variety of waste materials. One of the most important
steps of waste management is the separation of the waste into the different components and this process is normally done manually by hand-picking.
Convolutional Neural Network model which is used to classify the waste into different groups/types such as glass, metal, paper, and plastic etc. The proposed system is 
tested on the trash image dataset which was developed by Gary Thung and Mindy Yang, and is able to achieve an accuracy of 92% on the dataset. The separation process of 
the waste will be faster and intelligent using the proposed waste material classification system without or reducing human involvement.

In this project,by using the convolutional neural network to classify an image as either cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, or trash. The image dataset collected
manually by Gary Thung and Mindy Yang was used here.
